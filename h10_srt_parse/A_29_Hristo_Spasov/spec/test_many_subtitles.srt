1
00:08:25,883 --> 00:08:29,553
Oh! Reznik talking smack,
I can't even respond to that.

2
00:08:50,612 --> 00:08:51,446
You ok?

3
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,407
Do I look ok?

4
00:08:56,701 --> 00:08:59,119
If you were any thinner, you wouldn't exist.

5
00:09:01,872 --> 00:09:02,580
What's wrong?

6
00:09:04,457 --> 00:09:06,499
I don't know, deja vu.

7
00:09:08,544 --> 00:09:10,253
You are tired, you need to sleep.

8
00:09:22,805 --> 00:09:24,765
How do you do it?

9
00:09:25,016 --> 00:09:25,557
What?

10
00:09:25,849 --> 00:09:28,434
Sleep so little and still look so good.

11
00:09:29,394 --> 00:09:30,436
Are you flirting with me?

12
00:09:31,479 --> 00:09:32,395
Commiserating.

13
00:09:35,649 --> 00:09:38,026
- Try to fatten me up?
- What if I am?

14
00:09:38,902 --> 00:09:40,986
Suppose I wanted blueberry.

15
00:09:41,613 --> 00:09:43,155
You had that last night.

16
00:09:43,363 --> 00:09:46,657
You don't fool me, Trevor Reznik.
I have you figured out.

17
00:09:47,326 --> 00:09:49,285
- You do, huh?
- Muhmmm.

18
00:09:50,995 --> 00:09:52,913
What else do you know about me?

19
00:09:54,789 --> 00:09:55,998
That you are lonely.

20
00:09:58,293 --> 00:10:02,588
When you work here as long as I have,
you get to know the type.

21
00:10:03,672 --> 00:10:09,135
Hey, everyone gets lonely, Trevor.
It is nothing to be ashamed of.

22
00:10:09,927 --> 00:10:14,639
How can I be lonely,
when I have you to keep me company?

23
00:10:14,723 --> 00:10:15,389
Check please!
