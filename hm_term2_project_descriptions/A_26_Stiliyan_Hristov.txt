Web app allowing users to view different local events or places of interest according to their personal profile preferences


The website will work in the same fashion as sites such as: eventful and so on,but with an easier and more optimal way of browsing through potential events that the client would enjoy and possibly attend.

-Local event browsing

-User added events/Event organizations
	Containing:
		What the meetup/event will be for?
		Is the event free or paid?
		Where the event is held?
-Google maps integration allows for fast and easy travel towards the users’ desired destination/event

-Friends list implementation: Check out what your friends are up to and in what mutual events you can partake

-User specific sorting by personal preference
	Later accompanied by the specific users’ attendance and event viewing history

-Perfect for local musical development(bands,concerts and etc.)

-Perfect for hobbyists

-Perfect for organization

-Possible Android release in the future

(Web app functionality subject to change)
